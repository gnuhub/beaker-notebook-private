# BeakerX: Beaker extensions for Jupyter

## Dependencies

* oracle Java8 JDK, gradle
* npm, bower, webpack
* conda

## Build and run
```
conda create -y -n beakerx python=3.5 jupyter pandas
source activate beakerx
(cd kernel/groovy; gradle --no-daemon kernelInstall)
(cd kernel/scala; gradle --no-daemon kernelInstall)
(cd kernel/java; gradle --no-daemon kernelInstall)
gradle --no-daemon environmentVariables # set PYTHONPATH as directed
jupyter notebook
```

## Update after java change
Ther kernels are installed to run out of the repo, so just a build should update the java code.
* `gradle build`

## update after JS change

* `cd beakerx/js; webpack`

If webpack gives an error like

> ERROR in jquery-ui (bower component) Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory' ./ui/jquery-ui.js

Then run `rm -rf bower_components && bower install`.

## Attribution

The kernel is originally derived from https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel, but has been rewritten in Java and refactored.
The Java support uses Adrian Witas org.abstractmeta.toolbox.
