# Groovy Jupyter Kernel

A [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) kernel for the [Apache Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org) language.
The kernel was [originally written by Lappsgrid](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel),
and then translated to Java and heavily modified by [Two Sigma Open Source](https://github.com/twosigma) to become part of BeakerX.
